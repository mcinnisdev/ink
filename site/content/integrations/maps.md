## Replacements

| WP Plugin | Ink Replacement | How to Embed | Free? | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WP Google Maps | [Google Maps Embed](https://maps.google.com) | iframe embed from Google Maps | Yes | Easy |
| MapPress | [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) | Script + div with map init JS | Limited | Medium |
| Store Locator Plus | [Radar.io](https://radar.io) | Script tag + API | Limited | Medium |

For service area pages, Ink generates a dedicated page per city or region. A simple Google Map iframe showing the service area is usually all you need -- no complex locator plugin required.
