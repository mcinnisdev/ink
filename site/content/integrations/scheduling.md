## Replacements

| WP Plugin | Ink Replacement | How to Embed | Free? | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bookly | [Calendly](https://calendly.com) | Inline embed or popup button | Limited | Easy |
| Amelia | [Cal.com](https://cal.com) | Iframe or script embed -- open source | Yes | Medium |
| Simply Schedule | [Acuity Scheduling](https://acuityscheduling.com) | Iframe embed code | Paid | Easy |
| WooCommerce Bookings | [Square Appointments](https://squareup.com) | Booking button embed | Yes | Easy |

## Recommended: Cal.com

Cal.com is open-source and free with clean embed options. For trades businesses, a simple Cal.com booking link embedded on a contact or service area page replaces an entire plugin with a much better user experience.
