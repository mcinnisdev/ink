## Replacements

| WP Plugin | Ink Replacement | How to Embed | Free? | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WP Review Pro | [Elfsight Reviews](https://elfsight.com) | Script + widget div tag | Paid | Easy |
| Google Reviews WP | [EmbedSocial](https://embedsocial.com) | Script embed in markdown HTML block | Paid | Easy |
| Trustpilot Widget | [Trustpilot (direct)](https://trustpilot.com) | Trustpilot embed code | Yes | Easy |
| WP Testimonials | Ink testimonials type | Native Ink content type -- no embed | Yes | Easy |

## Recommended: Native Ink Testimonials

For static testimonials from past customers, Ink's built-in testimonials content type is the cleanest approach. The AI generates the markdown files, they render beautifully, and there's nothing to embed or maintain. For live Google review feeds, EmbedSocial or a direct Google Places embed works well.
