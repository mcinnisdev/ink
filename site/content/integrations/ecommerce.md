## The Headless Shopify Play

Shopify's Storefront API lets you use Ink for the frontend -- fast static pages, AI-generated product descriptions, clean URLs, perfect SEO -- while Shopify handles cart, checkout, inventory, and payments. Compelling for small product catalogs. The AI generates a markdown file per product, Ink builds the pages, Shopify handles transactions.

Lemon Squeezy is the easiest path for digital products -- they handle VAT/tax globally and the embed is a single line.
