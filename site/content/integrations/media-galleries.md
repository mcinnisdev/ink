## Replacements

| WP Plugin | Ink Replacement | How to Embed | Free? | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Envira Gallery | Ink image gallery component | Native Ink component -- no embed needed | Yes | Easy |
| NextGen Gallery | [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) | Cloudinary widget script | Limited | Medium |
| YouTube Embed Plugin | YouTube iframe | Standard iframe in markdown HTML block | Yes | Easy |
| Vimeo Everything | Vimeo embed (direct) | Vimeo iframe -- no plugin needed | Yes | Easy |

Ink's built-in image gallery component handles most use cases natively. For video, standard YouTube and Vimeo iframes work directly in markdown HTML blocks with no plugin required.
