## No Plugin Needed

Wordfence and Sucuri exist because WordPress is a high-value attack target -- PHP execution, database access, admin login pages, plugin vulnerabilities. A static Ink site has none of these.

## What You Don't Need to Worry About

- **No PHP execution** -- there is no server-side code to exploit
- **No database** -- there is no SQL to inject
- **No admin panel** -- there is no login page to brute force
- **No plugin vulnerabilities** -- there are no plugins running server-side code
- **HTTPS by default** -- handled automatically by Cloudflare Pages for free

The entire attack surface that WordPress security plugins defend against simply does not exist on a static site.
