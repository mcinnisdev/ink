## No Plugin Needed

SEO is baked into Ink. It generates clean semantic HTML, proper meta tags, Open Graph tags, canonical URLs, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt automatically from your markdown frontmatter. This is what Yoast and RankMath do under the hood -- Ink just does it natively.

## What You Get Out of the Box

- **Meta title and description** from markdown frontmatter
- **Open Graph and Twitter Card tags** for social sharing
- **Canonical URL generation** -- no duplicate content issues
- **Auto-generated sitemap.xml** on every build
- **Clean URL structure** with no `/index.php?p=123` cruft
- **Structured data (JSON-LD)** via frontmatter fields
- **Fast page load** = better Core Web Vitals = better rankings

Static Ink sites are naturally faster than WordPress -- your Core Web Vitals improve just from the migration, which directly benefits SEO rankings.
