The installer is an `.exe` file. Run it and follow the prompts to install.

### System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- **Runtime**: [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) must be installed
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- **Disk**: ~200 MB for the application

### Code Signing Note

The installer is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning. Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"** to proceed.

### Auto-Updates

Ink checks for updates automatically on launch. When a new version is available, you can download and install it directly from **Settings > About & Updates**.

## Linux

Ink is built with Electron and should run on most Linux distributions, but Linux is not officially supported at this time. If you'd like to build from source, clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcinnisdev/ink) and run `npm run dist:linux` from the `app/` directory.
