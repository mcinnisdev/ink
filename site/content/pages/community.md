Ink is built in the open, and we welcome contributors of all experience levels. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request, you're helping make Ink better for everyone.

## GitHub

The Ink source code is hosted on GitHub. This is the central hub for development, issue tracking, and releases.

- [Ink on GitHub](https://github.com/mcinnisdev/ink)
- [Ink Starter Template](https://github.com/mcinnisdev/ink-starter)

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved:

- **Report bugs** -- Found something broken? Open an issue on GitHub with steps to reproduce.
- **Request features** -- Have an idea for Ink? Start a discussion or file a feature request.
- **Submit pull requests** -- Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a PR. We review every submission.
- **Improve documentation** -- Spot a typo or unclear explanation? Documentation PRs are always appreciated.
- **Share your site** -- Built something with Ink? Let us know. We'd love to see what you create.

## Code of Conduct

We're committed to providing a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone. All participants in the Ink community are expected to treat others with courtesy and professionalism. Harassment, discrimination, and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Discord (Coming Soon)

We're setting up a Discord server for real-time discussion, support, and community interaction. Stay tuned -- we'll announce the invite link on the [blog](/blog/) and on GitHub when it's ready.
