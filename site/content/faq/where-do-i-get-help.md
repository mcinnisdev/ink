The best place to start is the [documentation](/docs/), which covers installation, configuration, content types, and deployment. If you run into a bug or have a feature request, open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcinnisdev/ink). For questions and community discussion, we're working on launching a Discord server -- stay tuned for an invite link. You can also browse the [blog](/blog/) for tutorials and updates.
