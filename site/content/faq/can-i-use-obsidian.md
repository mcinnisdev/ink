Yes! Ink's content directory is fully compatible with Obsidian. Simply open your project's `content/` folder as an Obsidian vault, and you can write and organize your Markdown files using Obsidian's rich editing environment -- including live preview, backlinks, and graph view. Since Ink uses standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter, everything you write in Obsidian is exactly what Ink expects. No conversion or syncing step needed.
