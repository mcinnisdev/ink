WordPress and most traditional CMS platforms require a database, a server, and an admin panel to manage content. Ink takes a fundamentally different approach. Your content lives as plain Markdown files in a folder -- no database to maintain, no login screen, no plugins to update, and no security patches to worry about. Content is version-controlled with Git, editable in any text editor, and fully portable. The output is static HTML that loads fast and can be hosted for free on most CDN platforms.
