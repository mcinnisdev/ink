Yes. Ink is completely free and open source under the MIT license. You can use it for personal projects, client work, or commercial sites without any cost or usage restrictions. There are no premium tiers, no feature gates, and no usage limits. The source code is available on GitHub, and contributions from the community are always welcome.
