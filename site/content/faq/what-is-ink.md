Ink is an open-source, Markdown-native content management system built on Eleventy v3. It includes a CLI tool that scaffolds a complete, production-ready website from a starter template. You write content in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, and Ink compiles everything into fast, static HTML pages. There's no database, no server runtime, and no admin panel -- just text files and a build step. The output can be deployed to any static hosting provider like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
