Eleventy (11ty) is a popular static site generator known for its speed, simplicity, and flexibility. It takes template files and content and compiles them into plain HTML -- no client-side JavaScript framework required. Ink uses Eleventy v3 as its build engine because it's fast, has zero mandatory configuration, and supports a huge ecosystem of plugins. Ink abstracts Eleventy's configuration so you can focus on content and design rather than build tooling.
